# Created by: Mike Ackerman
# Created date: January 2020
# Purpose:
#   I want to generate plots by watershed and life stage showing
#   the longitudinal temperature profile for the time period within 
#   that life stage and show optimum, max, and acute (other?) temps on the profile
#   with geom_ribbon and geom_hline. Will show rkms where temperatures exceeds 
#   (or subceeds) a given threshold.
#
#   To be used in MRA reports to help in project prioritization.
