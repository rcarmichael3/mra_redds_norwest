# Introduction

The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), Idaho Governor's Office of Species Conservation (OSC), and an interdisciplinary team of partners have assembled an Upper Salmon Assessment Team to complete biologic and geomorphic analyses in support of future project identification, prioritization, and design in the Upper Salmon Subbasin, Idaho targeted at improving stream and riparian habitat to support imperiled Chinook salmon and steelhead populations. The biologic and geomorphic analyses are being lead by Biomark, Inc. (Biomark) and Rio Applied Science and Engineering (Rio ASE), respectively. Past efforts from the team resulted in the development of a watershed-scale Integrated Rehabilitation Assessment (IRA; Idaho OSC Team 2019) in the Lemhi, Pahsimeroi, and Upper Salmon (Sawtooth Valley) watersheds. This inital phase of the project identified the "problem" by spatially quantifying capacity limitation for spring/summer chinook salmon and summer run steelhead within a geomorphic context across these threee watersheds. The second phase, termed the Multiple Reach Assessments (MRA), includes identifying appropriate and focused "solutions" to the identified capacity problems within four valley segments: Upper Lemhi, Lower Lemhi, Lower Pahsimeroi,a nd Upper Salmon (Decker Flats). To achieve this goal, the team will collaboratively summarize existing and targeted physical habitat conditions relative to document habitat needs for specific species and life stages, including discussion of high-quality habitat, its creation, and its maintenance to inform future rehabilitation actions.

In the IRA, we determined that available spawning habitat (i.e., redd capacity) was not limiting in any of the target watersheds (Lemhi River, Pahsimeroi River, and upper Salmon River above Redfish Lake Creek) for either Chinook salmon or steelhead. With that said, we acknowledge that habitat actions in the target watersheds should attempt to take a "do no harm" approach and minimize negative impacts to spawning habitat, especially in existing core spawning areas. Additionally, it was stated in the IRA that *"providing sufficient adult holding (prespawn) habitat should be considered and would be provided by increased habitat complexity".* Finally, we found that *"spawning habitat historically occurred farter upstream than current core areas, especially in the Upper Salmon River headwaters, effectively reducing the area currently available for rearing (i.e., area downstream of spawning).*

<!--

In the IRA, it was determined that, for Chinook salmon, habitat capacity was limited to support presmolts during winter months, and to a slightly lesser degree, parr during summer months. Habitat was not found to be limiting for adult spawning. For steelhead, habitat capacity was identified as limiting for juvenile rearing, at least in the Pahsimeroi River; again, habitat was not found to be limiting for adult spawning. The available habitat capacity was estimated using quantile regression forest (QRF; IRA Appendix B) whereas habitat requirements were estimated for current escapement and recovery goals using a generalized capacity model (IRA Appendix C).

The goal of this document is to further delve into existing conditions and evaluate the hydraulic suitability, particularly depth and velocity, of the four target valley segments to support select life stages of Chinook salmon and steelhead. By comparing depth and velocity suitability curves for Chinook salmon and steelhead (Maret et al. 2006) to modeled depths and velocities available for the four valley segments, we can further our understanding of how habitat may be limiting recovery of Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Upper Salmon subbasin. This information can help identify geomorphic reaches where existing depth and velocity may be limiting particular species and life stages, which could prove useful for project prioritization.

## Objectives

<!--
Evaluate the composite suitability of geomorphic reaches in the upper Lemhi, lower Lemhi, lower Pahsimeroi, and upper Salmon (Decker Flat) valley segments based on modeled depth and velocity raster available from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) models available from those areas. Composite suitability is evaluated for both Chinook salmon and steelhead and for adult spawning and juvenile rearing at various discharge scenarios (see Table \@ref(tab:scenarios-tab)). The proportion of each geomorphic reach classified as simple, mixed, or complex is also provided for reference.
