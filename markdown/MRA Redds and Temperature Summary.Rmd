# Introduction

The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), Idaho Governor's Office of Species Conservation (OSC), and an interdisciplinary team of partners have assembled an Upper Salmon Assessment Team to complete biologic and geomorphic analyses in support of future project identification, prioritization, and design in the Upper Salmon Subbasin, Idaho targeted at improving stream and riparian habitat to support imperiled Chinook salmon and steelhead populations. The biologic and geomorphic analyses are being lead by Biomark, Inc. (Biomark) and Rio Applied Science and Engineering (Rio ASE), respectively. Past efforts from the team resulted in the development of a watershed-scale Integrated Rehabilitation Assessment (IRA; Idaho OSC Team 2019) in the Lemhi, Pahsimeroi, and Upper Salmon (Sawtooth Valley) watersheds. This inital phase of the project identified the "problem" by spatially quantifying capacity limitation for spring/summer chinook salmon and summer run steelhead within a geomorphic context across these threee watersheds. The second phase, termed the Multiple Reach Assessments (MRA), includes identifying appropriate and focused "solutions" to the identified capacity problems within four valley segments: Upper Lemhi, Lower Lemhi, Lower Pahsimeroi,a nd Upper Salmon (Decker Flats). To achieve this goal, the team will collaboratively summarize existing and targeted physical habitat conditions relative to document habitat needs for specific species and life stages, including discussion of high-quality habitat, its creation, and its maintenance to inform future rehabilitation actions.

In the IRA, we determined that available spawning habitat (i.e., redd capacity) was not limiting in any of the target watersheds (Lemhi River, Pahsimeroi River, and upper Salmon River above Redfish Lake Creek) for either Chinook salmon or steelhead. Available spawning capacity was estimated as the total number of redds that each watershed could support and was estimated using quantile regression forest (QRF; Idaho OSC Team 2019, Appendix B) models and the number of redds required to support contemporary escapement or escapement to support recovery goals (e.g., minimum abundance thresholds [MAT]) was estimated using a generalized capacity model (Idaho OSC Team 2019, Appendix C). It was instead concluded that juvenile rearing habitat, during both summer and winter months, was likely limiting productivity of Chinook salmon and steelhead populations in target watersheds. Additionally, life stages not evaluated there (e.g., incubation, fry) may contribute to limited productivity in these populations. With that said, we acknowledge that future habitat actions in the target watershed should attempt to take a "do no harm" approach and minimize any negative impacts to available spawning habitat, especially in existing core spawning areas. But we believe that any appropriate actions to improve juvenile rearing will likely cause minimal or no negative impacts to spawning habitat, especially if habitat complexity (e.g., increased pool frequency with following pool-tail, riffle sequences) is considered. Additionally, if was stated in the IRA that *"providing sufficient adult holding (prespawn) habitat should be considered and would be provided by increased habitat complexity"*. Within the Lemhi, Pahsimeroi, and Upper Salmon watersheds, Chinook salmon may hold in reaches downstream or near the spawning areas in late-July and August prior to the spawning season, a time where high stream temperatures can be problematic. And finally, the Idaho OSC Team found that *"spawning habitat historically occurred farther upstream than current core ares, especially in the Upper Salmon River headwaters, effectively reducing the area currently available for rearing (i.e., area downstream of spawning).* One of the goals of this evaluation is to document the location and distribution of spawning redds in the target watersheds for recent years in which redd surveys were completed and data are available. Redd survey data were made available by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG). Here, modeled stream temperatures available from McNyset et al. (2015) are compared to recent redd density data to determine whether temperatures are appropriate or perhaps problematic in those areas; we can also consider areas that may have historically been used for spawning.  



## Objectives

<!--
Evaluate the composite suitability of geomorphic reaches in the upper Lemhi, lower Lemhi, lower Pahsimeroi, and upper Salmon (Decker Flat) valley segments based on modeled depth and velocity raster available from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) models available from those areas. Composite suitability is evaluated for both Chinook salmon and steelhead and for adult spawning and juvenile rearing at various discharge scenarios (see Table \@ref(tab:scenarios-tab)). The proportion of each geomorphic reach classified as simple, mixed, or complex is also provided for reference.
